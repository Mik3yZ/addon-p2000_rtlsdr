# Home Assistant Add-on: P2000 RTL-SDR

## WARNING

Even though this add-on was created and is maintained with care and with security in mind, it maybe damage your system. Use at your own risk.


## How does it work?

When the program starts the configuration data is read and parsed.  
It then tries to find the usb port that your RTL-SDR dongle is connected to, and performs a port reset.  

It loads the database data like capcodes and city information, next the MQTT sender is initialized and the add-on is announced on the MQTT availability topic.  

A thread is started to start receiving data from the dongle, this is done by starting a rtl_fm process tunes to the exact frequency of the P2000 waves, rtl_fm pipes the data through multimon-ng to decode FLEX data, every line which starts with 'FLEX' is parsed.  

As much data as possible is extracted, other data is added like lat/long and a mapurl for openstreetmap, all is put in the message queue, another data parse thread is checking new messages against the configured filters and sensors.  

When a message data matches the filters, the sensor values are updated through MQTT publish. If the sensor publishes it's first data after a restart the sensor is announced on the MQTT bus as well so home-assistant creates it automatically for you.


## Installation
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.

1. Add my add-ons repository to your home assistant instance  
   (in supervisor addons store at top right, or click button below if you have configured my HA)  
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMik3yZ%2Faddon-p2000_rtlsdr)
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Set the add-on options to your preferences (see below)
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.


Make sure your RTL-SDR dongle is inserted in the Home assistant device.  
Place your antenna in a good location near the window, or even outside.

If you don't see the wanted result, consider setting verbosity to 'debug' and restart.  
Don't leave verbosity debug enabled for a long time, since it logs a lot of data, and can wear out your storage devices.

Default: `false`

 - true: Enabled
 - false: Disabled

### Option `mqtt`: `tls_ca`
The certificate to use if `tls_enabled` is true  
Example: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `id`
This section specifies one or more P2000_sensors with their filter criteria.
`id` is a mandatory setting, specify an unique value without spaces or special characters, numbers are convenient.

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `name`

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `icon`
`icon` is an optional setting, if not specifed the 'mdi:fire-truck' icon is used.

Thee following filters are 'matching filters' opposed to the global filter which are 'ignore values'.

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `zone_radius` `zone_longitude` `zone_latitude`
These are optional (but they are a set and belong to each other)  
You can combine them _but this is optional as well_ with one or more of the criteria settings below.

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `keyword`
This setting is optional. You can specify one or more keyword seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the text in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text and it's attributes are applied to the sensor.

NOTE: The function used to match this filter is called `fnmatch`.

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `capcode`
This setting is optional. You can specify one or more capcodes seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the capcodes in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text it's attributes are applied to the sensor.
NOTE: Capcodes used in this add-on are 9 positions long, if you found one shorter append 0's from the left.

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `region`
This setting is optional. You can specify one or more regions seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the region in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text and it's attributes are applied to the sensor.
Available regions are:  
`Groningen`  
`Friesland`

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `discipline`
This one is optional too. You can specify one or more disciplines seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the discipline linked to the capcode in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text and it's attributes are applied to the sensor.
Available disciplines are:  

`Ambulance`  
`Brandweer`  
`Politie`  
`Reddingsbrigade`

### Option `p2000_sensors`: `location`
This one is optional too. You can specify one or more locations seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the location data linked to the capcode in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text and it's attributes are applied to the sensor.
This is a free text field, not all of them are known/filled in.

NOTE: `location` data comes from the local database and is not the same as address or city (which are extracted from the messages)


### Option `p2000_sensors`: `remark`
This one is optional too. You can specify one or more remark texts seperated by comma's, if at least one of them matches the remark data linked to the capcode in the message received -and any other criteria (if any) for this sensor matches- the message text and it's attributes are applied to the sensor.
This is a free text field, only a few are filled-in but these are often specific ones like `Narcotica team`, `Onderhandelaar`, `First-Responders`

### Option `tts_replacements`
TTS replacements can be used to change the message to a string which can be used to speak the alarm message. It can be used for example to change the firefighter designations to a text better suitable for speaking (e.g. 224541 to 45 41) or remove the incident channel from the message (e.g. BOB-02).

### Option `tts_replacements`: `pattern`
The pattern to search for in the message

### Option `tts_replacements`: `replacement`
The replacement, use an empty string to completely remove part of the message (e.g. the incident channel)


NOTE: `region`, `discipline`, `location` and `remark` information is looked-up in a local database using the `capcodes` retrieved from the messages. It's not available in the over-the-air traffic, so it can be incomplete, outdated and incorrect.
